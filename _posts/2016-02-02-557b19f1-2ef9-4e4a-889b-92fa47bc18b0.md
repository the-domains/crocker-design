# Forgotten South

This is an ongoing project to explore places in the south that, at one point, used to be places that were used every day, but now they are just sitting empty and aging.  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1317036e-73ff-431b-ac52-c77a18476f85.jpg)

The contrast of light and dark in these environments is meant to highlight the idea that years ago these places were once meaningful, but now they are fading away.

These places have a story and a history. People walked, and worked here daily, but now they are just abandoned and left to rust away.

While this all seems gloomy and sad, I find it rather beautiful, because it allows for this moment of solace and serenity to be experienced in a unique way.

As it fades away it and nature runs it's course the places open up to the environment around them and starts to invite the elements into the space and become a new page in the building's history.

Things aren't beautiful because they last and this project is meant to embrace that things pass with time, but that in itself is what makes them beautiful.
